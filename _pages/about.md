Hi! I'm Tiphaine Viard, a *maîtresse de conférences* (~associate professor) in the Digital technologies, organisation and society team at Telecom Paris.

I am interested in working on artificial intelligence and data analysis from a sociotechnical perspective.
My main project (CHAI, ANR funded) aims at charting the social world of AI, and study how norms and definitions circulate among actors, institutions and across heterogeneous arenas (scientific, press, regulation, NGOs). It examines the levers of influence and power in this space, and aims at materialising AI issues, through its environmental cost, human cost, and impact on civic discourse.

You can find more information about my [current projects](projects/), the [courses I teach in](teaching/) or my [complete CV](assets/pdf/CV_Tiphaine_Viard.pdf).
You can also follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://lipn.info/@t_viard">Mastodon</a> to get a more "day-to-day" version of my work.
