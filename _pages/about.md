Hi! I'm Tiphaine Viard, a *maîtresse de conférences* (~associate professor) in the Digital technologies, organisation and society team at Telecom Paris.

I am interested in working on artificial intelligence and data analysis from a sociotechnical perspective.
My main methods are graph analysis and computational sociology.

Currently, my main focus is on charting artificial intelligence, eliciting the relations betweeen concepts, persons and institutions over time.

You can find more information about my [current projects](projects/), the [courses I teach in](teaching/) or my [complete CV](assets/pdf/CV_Tiphaine_Viard.pdf).
You can also follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://lipn.info/@t_viard">Mastodon</a> to get a more "day-to-day" version of my work.

Current PhD supervisions:
- Simon Delarue (2021-), co-supervised (50%) with Thomas Bonald,
- Lilian Marey (2024-), co-supervised (30%) with Charlotte Laclau and Bruno Sguerra.
