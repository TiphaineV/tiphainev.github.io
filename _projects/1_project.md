We focused on twitter data related to the 2022 Ethiopian war.
Instead of focusing on hashtags, we instead present a methodology based on the identification of relevant users, and build a dataset from these.


Participants:
  - Haileleul Haile
  - Tiphaine Viard
  - Val√©rie Beaudouin
  - Thomas Bonald
